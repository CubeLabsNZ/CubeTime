# Txmer privacy policy

Txmer itself does not collect any data, "personal" or otherwise.    
Your solves (data not comprising of personal information including but not limited to the "scramble" used, the date of the solve, the time taken to complete the solve) and your sessions (data including but not limited to named groups of solves, again with no personal data) are stored locally on your device or optionally on iCloud (see below).    
There are, however two notable things to be aware of:
1. **Optionally**, Txmer will use the WCA (World Cubing Assocciation)'s API to retrieve your publically available solves, for the sole purpose of stats calculation. Once retrieved, it is stored locally on device. It requires you to enter your WCA ID, which is used solely for the purpose of retrieving your solves, and can optionally be saved locally for use next time you want to sync solves. The WCA's privacy policy is available at https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/privacy
2. **Optionally**, Txmer will use Apple iCloud to store your sessions. The data stored on iCloud can be viewed and deleted in the Txmer app. The Apple iCloud privacy policy is available at https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/

The source code of txmer is publically viewable at https://github.com/pdtcubing/txmer for independent verification.
