    /// ```
    ///    import SwiftUI
    ///
    ///    struct ContentView: View {
    ///
    ///        @State private var counter: Int = 0
    ///
    ///        var body: some View {

    ///
    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - counter: on any change of this variable the animation is run
    ///   - num: amount of confettis
    ///   - colors: list of colors that is applied to the default shapes
    ///   - confettiSize: size that confettis and emojis are scaled to
    ///   - rainHeight: vertical distance that confettis pass
    ///   - fadesOut: reduce opacity towards the end of the animation
    ///   - opacity: maximum opacity that is reached during the animation
    ///   - openingAngle: boundary that defines the opening angle in degrees
    ///   - closingAngle: boundary that defines the closing angle in degrees
    ///   - radius: explosion radius
    ///   - repetitions: number of repetitions of the explosion
    ///   - repetitionInterval: duration between the repetitions
    ///
