### Upcoming Features

You can view our [Todo List for this repo](https://github.com/orgs/CubeStuffs/projects/3) for a list of all our upcoming features. You can add suggestions by opening an issue.
Here's an outline of some of the major upcoming features
- Support for bluetooth cubes
- Support for stackmats
- Importing sessions and solves from common timers, such as ChaoTimer and csTimer
- Easy to use export to save your sessions
- Algorithm Trainer and more to come...

## Introductory User Guide

### Timer
Press and hold until the timer turns green to start. You can change the hold time in settings.
The default gestures are as follows:
- swipe left to delete the current solve
- swipe right to generate a new scramble
- swipe down to add a penalty

On iPads, you can use your trackpad to two-finger swipe in the same way as your finger.

### Time List
All your solves in the currently selected session will be displayed in your time list.
Pressing the select button on the top right will enter selection mode, where you can batch select, delete, move or penalise solves.
Pressing on the seach icon will reveal the search bar, where you can search for your times.
You can also filter for scramble types, penalties and comments, along with sorting your times.
Searching while in select mode will preserve your current selection.

Clicking on a solve will bring up the solve details, the time, date, event and scramble.
You can add a comment if you wish by typing in the comment box.
"Copy Solve" will copy the solve details to your clipboard.
"Share Solve" allows you to share it to other apps or save as a file.

### Stats
The default stats view shows your current and best averages of 5, 12 and 100, the number of solves in the session, session mean and your best single.
Clicking on each of the stats will bring up a detail view, such as the solves in your average.

### Sessions
Create a new session by clicking the "New Session" button.
You can select from different types of sessions:
1. Standard Session: is a normal session where the scramble is fixed to the session event
2. Multiphase: times many phases during your solve, useful in blind or analysing your solve breakdown
3. Playground: session with no fixed scramble type, you can change the scramble within the session
4. Comp Sim: non-rolling session that records solves in averages of x, instead of a big session. Simulates competitions

Pinning a session will make the session bigger and stickied at the top of sessions, and you can pin a session when creating or by long pressing on a session to access the menu.
Deleting a session will delete *all* your solves in that session, so be careful!

### Settings
You can customise almost all settings in the app and the appearance and themes.

### Tools
You can access the tools menu through settings on iPhone (or split view iPad) and through the menu icon on large iPad modes. CubeTime has basic timer and scramble only modes, along with a batch scramble generator and average calculator.

## Some final stuff
